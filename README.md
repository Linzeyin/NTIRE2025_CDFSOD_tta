# NTIRE2025_CDFSOD
code for the **Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD)** competition.
The files **dataset1_10shot.vitl14.bbox_ori.pkl** and **dataset3_10shot.vitl14.bbox_ori.pkl** are relatively large and have been compressed in the prototypes_init_workshop folder. They need to be decompressed during inference. Thank you for your understanding.
